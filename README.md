## Description

This repository contains the code for a CMS-style blog site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts. This website follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
